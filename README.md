# PIDO
The Parasite Infectious Disease Ontology (PIDO) extension of IDO is designed to serve as a reference ontology for eukaryotic pathogens and parasitic pathogenesis more generally. Its scope encompasses the detailed characterization of parasites, including their taxonomy, genetic composition, and reproduction mechanisms. It also addresses parasite diseases, their clinical manifestations, and the biological processes involved in host-parasite interactions.
